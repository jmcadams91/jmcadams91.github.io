                        <p>
                            I chose to advance the Travlr Getaways API to demonstrate core full stack development
                            skills. I architected a secure and scalable backend by refactoring the system
                            into modular controllers, implementing JWT authentication to protect data modifying
                            endpoints, and using environment variables for configuration. A key part of the
                            process involved debugging complex backend issues, including resolving a
                            persistent 500 Internal Server Error caused by a database connection timeout.
                            This project showcases my proficiency in modern backend architecture, API
                            security, and effective problem solving in a server-side environment.

                        <p>
                            In the Software Design and Engineering category, I fully met several key course
                            outcomes. Through enhancements such as middleware integration, route
                            refactoring, and validation logic, I demonstrated secure coding practices and
                            built maintainable, modular components using Express and TypeScript. These
                            updates reflect my ability to work with industry standard frameworks and
                            document systems clearly for reviewers and collaborators.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, there are still areas I’d like to expand on. While the artifact showcases
                            strong architectural design, it does not yet include cloud deployment or
                            serverless infrastructure—skills I intend to deepen through Azure and AWS
                            certification. Additionally, although the code is secure and well structured,
                            it doesn’t explicitly address ethical or legal computing implications, which I
                            aim to incorporate into future projects.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure</h3>
                        <p>
                            This artifact showcases the enhanced tripsList backend controller for the Travlr Getaways
                            application. I evolved its original logic to include dynamic, user driven
                            features by implementing several algorithmic solutions. Key upgrades include a
                            case insensitive search filter using regular expressions, dynamic sorting based
                            on user selected criteria (price, rating, location), and an availability
                            checker built on an abstracted date-comparison utility. The work is supported
                            by a full unit test suite and annotated with notes on time complexity,
                            demonstrating my ability to build efficient, maintainable, and well documented
                            backend logic.

                            The enhancements in this category allowed me to meet outcomes related to
                            algorithmic implementation and performance optimization. I developed search,
                            sort, and availability filtering logic, and introduced indexing and utility
                            functions that improved both speed and maintainability. These updates show my
                            ability to apply algorithmic thinking in practical, user facing contexts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That said, I recognize that I haven’t yet explored advanced algorithmic analysis in
                            depth. Concepts like recursive structures, dynamic programming, or formal Big-O
                            comparisons weren’t central to this artifact. Additionally, while the technical
                            documentation is clear, the artifact doesn’t include communication strategies
                            for non technical stakeholders, which is something I plan to address in future
                            interdisciplinary work.

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Enhancement Three: Databases</h3>
                        <p>
                            To demonstrate core backend security and database skills, I transformed the Travlr Getaways
                            User model into a production ready Mongoose schema. This enhancement highlights
                            my proficiency in implementing industry standard security practices, such as
                            password hashing with bcrypt, and designing schemas with strict field level
                            validation. The process also involved resolving real world development hurdles,
                            including TypeScript module compatibility and system level environment
                            configuration, showcasing my ability to build and troubleshoot secure,
                            maintainable backend systems.

                        <p>
                            The Databases category reflects some of my strongest progress. I fully met outcomes
                            related to data modeling, secure query integration, and schema normalization. I
                            built middleware for validation, implemented indexing strategies, and created
                            reproducible seed logic, all of which support scalable, secure, and reviewer friendly
                            backend systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Still, there are opportunities to grow. This artifact hasn’t yet been deployed to a
                            cloud based database platform like MongoDB Atlas or Azure Cosmos DB, which
                            would demonstrate infrastructure readiness. Additionally, while the system is
                            secure and well documented, it doesn’t explicitly model ethical data handling
                            frameworks such as GDPR or HIPAA—topics I’d like to explore as I deepen my
                            understanding of privacy aware architecture.
